# User Service

The User Service owns student and administrator identities, profiles, NUS email
verification, authentication sessions, refresh tokens, and privilege data.
Other services refer to users by stable identifiers and must not read this
service's persistence store directly.

## Current scope

The service foundation is initialized with NestJS, Fastify, TypeScript, strict
static analysis, a smoke test, and a production-oriented container build.
Registration, authentication, persistence, and email delivery are intentionally
deferred to later commits.

## Architecture

The service uses feature-first modules with clean boundaries inside each
feature:

```text
src/
|-- main.ts                 Process bootstrap only
|-- app.module.ts           Composition root only
|-- modules/
|   `-- <feature>/
|       |-- domain/         Entities, value objects, and domain rules
|       |-- application/    Use cases and ports
|       |-- infrastructure/ Port implementations and persistence adapters
|       `-- presentation/   HTTP controllers, DTOs, and message handlers
|-- platform/               Process-level database, configuration, and messaging
`-- shared/                 Small service-local technical or domain primitives
```

Dependency direction is inward:

```text
presentation -> application -> domain
infrastructure ------^          ^
```

The domain layer must not import NestJS, Prisma, Fastify, RabbitMQ, or other
framework code. Application code depends on interfaces (ports); infrastructure
implements those ports. Feature modules must not reach into another feature's
infrastructure directory.

## Local commands

Run these commands from `user-service/`:

```text
corepack pnpm install
corepack pnpm start:dev
corepack pnpm check
corepack pnpm build
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local overrides. The service listens on port
`3001` by default.

## Deferred milestones

1. PostgreSQL and Prisma foundation
2. Account domain model and registration
3. NUS email verification
4. Login, JWT access tokens, and rotating refresh tokens
5. Profile and credential updates
6. Administrator authorization and initial account seeding
