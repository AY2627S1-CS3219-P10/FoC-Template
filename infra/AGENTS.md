# Infra agent instructions

Follow the repository-wide instructions in `../AGENTS.md` and the canonical
stack in `../docs/tech-stack.md`.

This folder owns the AWS deployment for the N4 cloud deployment and DevOps
goal: AWS CDK (TypeScript) stacks, deployment helper images, and load tests. It
must not contain application domain logic or change another service's code.

- Owner: Hasan Ahmed Nasif. Work on branch `n4-cloud-deployment` and merge
  `origin/main` into it before each phase and before committing.
- Target: the team's NUS Innovation Sandbox account, region `ap-southeast-1`.
  Service control policies deny every other region except `us-east-1`, which
  is allowed for global services. Sign in with `aws sso login --profile foc`.
- Create, change, and delete AWS resources only through CDK in this folder.
  Use the AWS MCP server and AWS CLI for documentation, pricing, read-only
  inspection, and troubleshooting.
- Run `cdk diff` before every deploy. Credits are limited, so tear down stacks
  that are not needed.
- Never commit credentials, secrets, or `cdk.out/`. Application secrets live in
  SSM Parameter Store or Secrets Manager and reach containers as ECS secrets.

# AWS Guidance

- Where these AWS rules conflict with the project's own instructions, the
  project's instructions take precedence.
- Prefer the AWS MCP Server for AWS interactions — it provides sandboxed
  execution, observability, and audit logging. If unavailable, use the
  AWS CLI directly.
- For any AWS task or question — building, configuring, migrating, debugging,
  or operating a service, writing SDK code, authoring CDK/CloudFormation, or
  answering how a service works — first call `aws___search_documentation` with
  topic `agent_skills` and load the matching skill with `aws___retrieve_skill`.
  Do this even when you believe you know the answer: skills carry current
  service behavior that your training may not. Prefer the skill's guidance over
  general knowledge. Skip it only for work that does not involve AWS.
- When uncertain about specific AWS details (API parameters, permissions,
  limits, error codes), verify against documentation rather than guessing.
  State uncertainty explicitly if you cannot confirm.
- Before reporting a count, a total, or that something does not exist, read
  every page of the results and search every Region and scope where it could
  be. If you could not, say the result is partial and name what you checked.
- To say what a system currently does, read what the runtime uses: the
  completed deployment, the alias or version that is invoked, the template the
  stack is running. A newer stored version, a draft, or a description field is
  not evidence of live behavior.
- Present a cause as confirmed only if data, configuration, or logs you read
  show it. Label anything else as unverified, and say what you would check
  next.
- When the user asks a specific question or names a suspected cause, confirm
  or rule out each cause they raised, and do not offer alternatives your evidence
  does not support.
- When creating infrastructure, prefer infrastructure-as-code (AWS CDK or
  CloudFormation) over direct CLI commands.
- When working with infrastructure, follow AWS Well-Architected Framework
  principles.
- Do not use em dashes in AWS resource names or descriptions. Use
  hyphens instead.

## Before you conclude

- Before deciding the AWS account can't hold what the request asks for,
  look. List the places it could live, such as S3 buckets, databases, and
  log groups, and read what is there.
- Don't conclude that records are missing from metadata, such as a
  creation date or a stored-bytes count, or from one query that failed or
  came back empty. Read the records another way, across the full time
  range, before reporting them absent.

## Secret Safety

- MUST load the `aws-secrets-manager` skill first for any secret,
  credential, API key, token, or password task. MUST NOT call
  `secretsmanager get-secret-value` or `batch-get-secret-value`, and MUST
  NOT hit the Secrets Manager Agent daemon directly. MUST use
  `{{resolve:secretsmanager:secret-id:SecretString:json-key}}` with
  `asm-exec` so the secret resolves at runtime without entering context.
